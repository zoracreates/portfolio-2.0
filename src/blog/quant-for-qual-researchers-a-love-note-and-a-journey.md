description: My working list of quant resoruces for qual researchers.
---
Much of my UX Research career has focused on qualitative research. And I've also been told that quantitative research is not a pre-requisite to being a UX Researcher. Perhaps that is true. I think giving people the opportunity to learn quant research along the way is important, and allows for diverse voices to enter into the field.

That said, the more research I do, the more I begin to value having a mixed methods toolbox. And after reading [Tim Harford's *The Data Detective*](https://timharford.com/books/datadetective/), I've become (surprisingly) excited and fascinated by the topic of statistics. And working with talented behavioral scientists, and compounded that interest.

So for the past year or so, I've embarked on a journey to hone my quant research skills, and I would love to encourage other qual researchers to do the same. For that reason, I'm starting a series on quant topics for researchers. 

Below are some of the topics I plan to cover. Some of these topics (like descriptive stats, card sorts, and tree tests), I'm experienced with. Other topics (like regression), I'm pretty new to. Either way, I hope writing will help solidify my knowledge and motivate others. This is not a comprehensive list, and I expect it to grow over time. I also plan to add links to articles as I write them. I've also included some resources that have helped me so far and that dive deeper into these topics than I can.

## General Stats Topics
- Descriptive statistics
	- Central tendency 
	- Frequency
	- Distribution
- Inferential statistics
	- Hypothesis testing
	- Confidence Intervals
	- Probability 
	- Correlation
		- Regression
		- Correlation Coefficient
		- Correlation matrixes

## Quant UXR topics
- Survey Design
- Tree test analysis
- Card sort analysis
- Quant Moderated Research Measures
- Statistical personas and clustering techniques
