## What I do
As a researcher for emerging personal investing products, I'm responsible for both foundational and tactical research of new and re-launched products. For the past year, I've focused on mobile products being developed in the new investors and Young Customers space. 

<h2 id="user-experience-research">User Experience Research</h2>

I've conducted led 23+ primary and secondary research studies across 3 different products, using a mix of methods:
- In-depth interviews
- Moderated and unmoderated usability studies
- Concept tests
- Tree tests
- Qualitative and quantitative surveys
- Literature reviews


<h2 id="democratization-of-research">Democratization of research</h2>

I also contribute to the scaling of research by educating and mentoring designers and product partners on how to properly plan and conduct unmoderated usability studies. This work enables partners to conduct the work they need, and frees up space for researchers to focus on more strategic work.


<h2 id="accessibility-research">Accessibility Research</h2>

From September 2022 to  January 2023, I co-lead a monthly accessibility learning series for associates. The goal of this series was to showcase the impact of good and poor accessible design. I collaborated with other researchers to interview various Fidelity associates with visual disabilities. We talked about their experiences navigating and using digital products, and they walked through examples of common challenges they encountered.
